# Chess AI Project

Hello! This project is still under development. 

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the following command to install all the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The main aim of this project is to create an AI logic for playing chess. The AI will act as a player and utilize the Minimax algorithm to make its moves.

I was heavily inspired to undertake this project after seeing a Tic Tac Toe game created using the Minimax algorithm.

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
